Hi everybody, my name is Andrea and i'm studying html. 
Under the supervision of a friend of mine i subscribed to Github and i'm using it to apply day by day what i'm learning.
Having said that i'm deeply sorry if you stambled upon this repository, it's not useful to you, but it is useful for me :)
